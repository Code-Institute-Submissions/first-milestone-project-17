# First Milestone Project


[Website](https://kilokilo12.github.io/first-milestone-project/)



## UX


### What is it?

This is a static website for a fictional new album release by a non-fictional British band [Kasabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasabian "Kasabian Wiki"). It is created for fans of the band and all music lovers to enable them to listen to music, find information and upcoming tour dates on one page.

The link to the deployed website is [here](https://kilokilo12.github.io/first-milestone-project/)

### User Stories

* As a fan of Kasabian, I want to listen to their music without having to navigate through many links
* As a music lover I want to find relevant info easily
* As a concert-goer I like to find links to upcoming concerts 
* As an artist I like beautiful colour schemes and layouts


### Layout

The website is a single scrolling page, consisting of five separate areas: **Home**, **About**, **Music**, **Tour Dates** and **Contact**. It has fixed navigation links on top of the screen, making it easy to navigate between different parts of the page.

The wireframes for this website are stored on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IL9Iy0zmTcOyDZGFOj1r6Cdo/Kasabian?node-id=0%3A1)

The website was built using HTML5 and CSS3 with a simple framework by Bootstrap 4, using Bootstrap classes for [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/), [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/), [jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/jumbotron/) and [contact form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/forms/).

Tour Dates section was built using Bootstrap and a widget by [bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com/), allowing users to follow the automatically updated view of upcoming (and previous) tour dates.



## Testing

- Used HP Pavilion Laptop 15-ck0xx for developing and testing. 
- Developer tools were used extensively to test responsiveness of the page and debugging.
- Two different browsers were tested on - Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- For tablet size testing used Samsung Tab A.
- For mobile functionality used Pocophone 1.
- Also on a numerous devices of friends and family.
- Tested HTML and CSS code with <https://validator.w3.org> and <http://www.css-validator.org/>.
- Tested different devices on <https://www.responsinator.com/>.


### Issues found during testing and solutions

During testing found following issues:
- Full screen video background was only showing left top corner on mobile devices. Decided to modify that and replace full screen with fixed width and height.
- The background video was taking quite long to load, after trying several different options it was cropped and compressed, black background was used for smoother transitioning.
- On mobile devices Bootstrap navbar expanded into top left hand side, changed that by adding a media query.
- Also on mobile devices, navbar items did not disappear when clicked on any link, solution found on this [page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42401606/how-to-hide-collapsible-bootstrap-4-navbar-on-click) and jQuery script added to the end of script files.
- Fixed background image was cutting off heads on mobile devices, fixed using CSS.
- Bandsintown widget had in-built styling that had to be overridden by using `!important` values on respective attributes.
- Contact form was not giving users any feedback, decided to create a new file ["submit.html"](https://kilokilo12.github.io/first-milestone-project/submit.html) to accommodate this
- Was getting an error regarding favicon. Fixed that by creating an icon using <https://www.favicon-generator.org/>
- After restructuring the files the fixed background was not loading, fixed this by using relative file path.


### User stories

- User 1 - Used desktop site, all links were working.
- User 2 - Used the form in **Contact** section, tried to leave a field empty but received an error message. When all fields filled, was taken to a new page with 'Thank you for your message' on it.
- User 3 - As a fan of Kasabian found that the band facts and quotes in **About** section were entertaining, also the background video looked great once it loaded.
- User 4 - Looked at the page on a mobile, loved the colour scheme and usability but found the background video was a bit too small. Tried to send a message using contact form without a valid email address but received an error message. Form worked after email address was amended.
- User 5 - Found the page very easy to use on a mobile and all the links were working, opening in a new tab.
- User 6 - As a fan of the band I enjoyed listening to the songs and used the *Find lyrics* and *Listen to the whole albums* links to listen more and sing along. Would have liked to see the whole lyrics on the page.
- User 7 - used the **Tour Dates** section to check previous concert dates and navigated to [bandsintown](www.bandsintown.com) website to see more information about tour dates.
