## Overview

### What is it?

This is a static website for a fictional new album release by a non-fictional British band Kasabian.

### Layout

The website is a single scrolling page, consisting of five separate areas: Home, About, Music, Tour Dates and Contact. It has navigation links on top of the screen, making it easy to navigate between different parts of the page.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 and CSS3
Bootstrap 4
jQuery - for bootsrap and modal
Font Awesome - for social media and blockquotes
Google Fonts - used Poppins
Visual Studio Code - for IDE and version control

The website was built using HTML5 and CSS3 on a simple framework by Bootstrap 4, using their navbar, grid system, jumbotron and contact form.
Tour Dates section was built using Bootstrap and a widget by bandsintown, allowing users to follow the automatically updated view of upcoming (and previous) tour dates.
