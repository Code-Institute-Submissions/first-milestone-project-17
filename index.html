                    Kasabian (/kəˈseɪbiən/ kə-SAY-bee-ən) are an English rock band formed in Leicester in 1997. The
                    band's original
                    members were vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Meighan" target="_blank">Tom
                        Meighan</a>, guitarist
                    and vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Pizzorno" target="_blank">Sergio

                        target="_blank">Chris
                        Edwards</a>. The band's line-up was completed by drummer <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Matthews_(drummer)" target="_blank">Ian Matthews</a> in
                    2004 after a
                    string of
                    session
                    drummers. Karloff
                    left the band in 2006 and founded a new band called Black Onassis. Jay Mehler joined as touring lead
                    guitarist in 2006.
                    Mehler left the band for Liam Gallagher's Beady Eye in 2013, to be replaced by Tim Carter. In 2010
                    and 2014, Kasabian
                    won the Q Awards for "Best Act in the World Today", while they were also named "Best Live Act" at
                    the 2014 Q Awards and
                    the 2007 and 2018 NME Awards. The band's music is often described as "indie rock", but Pizzorno has
                    said he "hates indie
                    bands" and does not feel Kasabian fit into that category.

                <p class="lead">
                    Kasabian have released six studio albums – Kasabian (2004), Empire (2006), West Ryder Pauper Lunatic
                    Asylum (2009),
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/H6BTJyAiJ8I" target="_blank">Velociraptor! (2011)</a>, 48:13 (2014), and

                        Loud
                        (2017)</a>. The band's music has been
                    described as a mix between
                    The Stone Roses and Primal Scream with the swagger of Oasis. Their music has won them several awards
                    and recognition
                    in the media, including a Brit Award in 2010 for Best British Group, and their live performances
                    have received
                    praise, the most notable of which was their appearance as headliners at the 2014 Glastonbury
                    Festival.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Over the past three years Kasabian have headlined Glastonbury, had their fifth number
                    one album and played a gig to
                    celebrate Leicester City, their team, winning the Premier League.

                    What could possibly be left on Kasabian's bucket list?

                    Nothing, and that is absolutely fine with them.

                    "If it all ended tomorrow, which it could, I would be ok with that," Serge told Newsbeat backstage
                    at Reading Festival.

                    "There isn't anything left to tick off the list but in a way that is exciting. "It's because we've
                    done it all, so the great thing about that is we can make more interesting things."

                    "It is in the league of heroes if you headline Reading and Leeds," Serge reckons.
                    They first played at the festival in 2004.

                    "It was our first time at Reading, we hadn't been to bed.

                    "We were dying and thinking how are we going to do the gig, but we did it."

                    He thinks it is the same feeling now, because they now have nothing to lose having ticked all the
                    boxes.

                    "You go on stage, when you are younger, and you have got to prove to everyone that it is good and
                    then you get to a
                    point when you sort of don't care whether they critics are nice or not."

                                        I'd broke my wrist<br>It all kicked off<br>
                                        I had no choice<br>
                                        You said that you didn't mind<br>
                                        'Cos love's hard to find...</p>
